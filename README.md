### Languages

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Python
* SQL
### Technologies & Frameworks

* Flask
* Bootstrap
* Postgres
* AWS S3 File Storage
  
## The Process
As someone who has gone through the process of applying for tech jobs, I know howe hard it can be. So hard that I lost track of all the rejections and 'ghostings' from companies. I thought I needed an app to solve this problem, so I can at least keep track of all my applications.

My main hurdle was database design, to make sure that the data makes sense. After overthinking it and creating more tables that I needed, I quickly purged all those and simplified it to make sure an MVP was created by the end.

During the process of building the app, I knew that designing the user interface and user experience was going to be a hurdle, so I opted to go with bootstrap, which allowed me to focus on the important functionalities of the app.
