## About The Project

This is the second project of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Flex Course. Full-Stack was the main requirement, and we sought out to build our first CRUD app that interacted with a database, complete with users and a sign-up/login process.

As someone who has gone through the process of applying for tech jobs, I know howe hard it can be. So hard that I lost track of all the rejections and 'ghostings' from companies. I thought I needed an app to solve this problem, so I can at least keep track of all my applications.

### Languages

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Python
* SQL
### Technologies & Frameworks

* Flask
* Bootstrap
* Postgres
*  ~~ AWS S3 File Storage ~~
*  Cloudinary
  
## The Process

My main hurdle was database design, to make sure that the data makes sense. After overthinking it and creating more tables that I needed, I quickly purged all those and simplified it to make sure an MVP was created by the end.

During the process of building the app, I knew that designing the user interface and user experience was going to be a hurdle, so I opted to go with bootstrap, which allowed me to focus on the important functionalities of the app.

Originally I was going to use AWS S3 for cloud management but that proved to be troublesome. After I got it working and I decided I generated a new key and that broke everything so I switched over to Cloudinary which only took 15 minutes to set up!

## Hurdles

The biggest hurdle overall was time. In order to meet the deadline, I had to downsize a lot of the original plan, that means cutting down features and parts of the UI. One of the main things was designing the database, I started out with 10+ tables and quickly culled it down for simplicity reasons.
## Unsolved Problems

* Links don't appear on the Heroku page but it appears locally
* Error Handling
* Preventing Database Duplicates
* UI Changes to make it look less like Bootstrap
